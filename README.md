# scPADGRN
scPADGRN: A PADMM approach for reconstructing dynamic gene regulatory network using single-cell RNA sequencing data

# Introduction

## General 

This repository contains R codes to implement scPADGRN and three demo datasets with their pre-processing scripts in the directory of \scPADGRN\data.

Directory \scPADGRN\man includes R Documentation files of each individual function. One '.Rd' file consists of description, usage, arguments, etc. of its function.

## Instructions

1.	Download all files by clone or download from the current Github page to a local directory.
2.	Open scRPADGRN.Rproj by Rstudio. Press command+shift+B to build the package.
3.	To reconstruct DGRNs of real data application, enter the directory scPADGRN/data/dataset1. In 'File' panes, click 'more' bottom and then click 'Set As Working Directory'. After setting the correct directory, run 'script_dataset1.R' file, and we will have DGRN of Dataset 1. DGRNs of Dataset 2 and 3 can be obtained in the same way.

## For other datasets

Prepare inputs:
X â€“  a list variable, with each element a numerical matrix containing gene expressions of time $t,(t=1,2,\cdots)$ . Row and column of the matrix are gene and cells.
N- an integer variable indicating the number of time points.
Run the following code, which will return the DGRN for your dataset X: 

<p>preADMM(N, X, alpha, beta, error)[[1]]<\p>
